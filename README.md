ASCII, stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. It is a 7-bit character code where each individual bit represents a unique character. This page shows the extended ASCII table which is based on the Windows-1252 character set which is an 8 bit ASCII table with 256 characters and symbols. It includes all ASCII codes from standard ASCII, and it is a superset of ISO 8859-1 in terms of printable characters. In the range 128 to 159 (hex 80 to 9F), ISO/IEC 8859-1 has invisible control characters, while Windows-1252 has writable characters. Windows-1252 is probably the most-used 8-bit character encoding in the world.

ASCII control characters (character code 0-31)
The first 32 characters in the ASCII-table are unprintable control codes and are used to control peripherals such as printers.

ASCII printable characters (character code 32-127)
Codes 32-127 are common for all the different variations of the ASCII table, they are called printable characters, represent letters, digits, punctuation marks, and a few miscellaneous symbols. You will find almost every character on your keyboard. Character 127 represents the command DEL.
